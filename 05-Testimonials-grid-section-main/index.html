            <h2> Verified Graduate</h2>
            <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
                in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.
            </p>
            <p1>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            <p>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</p>
            <p1>“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
                for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p1>

            <h2> Verified Graduate</h2>
            <p> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
                learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
            <p1> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
                gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
                junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
                an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p1>

                <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                <p1>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                    staff
                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                    team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                    tutorial
                    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                    offers.
                    100% recommend! ”</p1>
